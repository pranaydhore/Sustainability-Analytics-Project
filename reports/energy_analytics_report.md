## ⚙️ Dataset Summary
- **Records analyzed:** 1,442
- **Time period:** 2006-12-16 → 2010-11-26
- **Source:** UCI Energy Dataset (Smart Meter Records)
- **Granularity:** Hourly and Daily Aggregations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Average Daily Consumption:** 25.86 kWh  
- **Maximum Daily Consumption:** 79.56 kWh  
- **Minimum Daily Consumption:** 0.00 kWh  
- **Peak Usage Hour:** 20:00 hrs  
- **Highest Consumption Day:** Saturday  
- **Estimated Total Carbon Emission:** 16777.69 kg CO₂

## 📈 Visualizations Generated
1️⃣ Daily Energy Trend with Rolling Average  
2️⃣ Hourly Energy Usage Pattern  
3️⃣ Distribution of Daily Energy Consumption  
4️⃣ Weekday Consumption Comparison  
5️⃣ Correlation Heatmap of Power Metrics  

---

## 🧠 Interpretation
The analysis reveals that energy consumption tends to peak during the evening hours (around 20:00 hrs).  
Weekends, particularly **Saturdays**, show higher energy use, possibly due to increased home activity.  
This insight can guide sustainability strategies, such as smart scheduling for high-power devices and improved awareness of carbon footprint impact.
